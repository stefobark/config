####the idea####

It might be a bit messy (and unfinished), but right now, you can make a sphinx configuration file for a plain index with a MySQL datasource. You can define multiple sources and multiple indexes and then one config block to define searchd settings. 

There are links to the Sphinx documentation on the input field titles. So, if you don't know what they do, follow the links.

####in action####
go [here](http://stevenjbarker.comoj.com) to see. Otherwise, grab these files and run them from your own machine. Either way, in the end, after answering a few questions, you'll get some text to copy and paste. Give it some name that ends with '.conf'.

####want to help?####
I'm new to all this stuff. So, please do tell me if you see a better way of doing things.

####Thanks :) ####
Hopefully this is helpful to someone!
