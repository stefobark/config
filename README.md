####The Idea####

I want to help people who are just getting started with Sphinx. So, I'm learning about PHP and building this Sphinx configuration tutorial. Check it out!

There are links to the Sphinx documentation on the input field titles. So, if you don't know what the options do, and if the descriptions are confusing, follow the links. If the documentation is confusing, check our [blog](http://sphinxsearch.com/blog/), [forum](http://sphinxsearch.com/forum/), tweet at me (@sphinxsearch or @steven_barker), or send a [note](http://sphinxsearch.com/about/contact/#contacts).

####In Action####
Go [here](http://stevenjbarker.comoj.com) to see what it looks like (I just put it up with some free hosting). Otherwise, grab these files and run them from your own machine. Either way, in the end, after answering a few questions, you'll get some text to copy and paste. Just give it a name that ends with '.conf' and use it to run indexer (unless you're using realtime indexes... then you don't need to think about indexer) and start searchd.

####Want to Help?####
I'm new to all this stuff. So, please do tell me if you see a better way of doing things.

####Thanks :) ####
Hopefully this helps someone!
